### What I learned

- Responsive Design: I've implemented responsive design by using media queries within styled-components, ensuring that the application looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Atomic Design Principles: I broke down the UI into smaller, reusable components following atomic design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages). [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
